// The record room's store — CARRIED, NOT REBUILT (Phase 3 Wave 1, 2026-08-13,
// an Opus hand). This comes from `resonance-assets/sistrum-inheritance/`, the
// recorder as it stood when it left the Compass, with the S25 freeze fix and
// the poll-generation guard already in it.
//
// The record verb is the spring's (`the-recorder`, via recorder.rs); this store
// is the room's window: reactive status, the takes shelf, and the sovereign-
// export door (KP's ⚛ storage ruling: storage in app, exports by the user's own
// hand). Opt-in by nature — nothing here fires except from the user's own tap,
// and nothing recorded ever touches a network.
//
// TWO DIFFERENCES from the inherited store, both deliberate:
//
//   1. `deleteTake` DID NOT COME. Lose-nothing: nothing in this wave deletes a
//      take's audio. The command does not exist in Rust either, so there is no
//      door to knock on by accident.
//
//   2. The wire type is `TakeFile`, not `Take`. In this body `Take` is the
//      DOMAIN row — the meaning around a take, which lives in the takes table.
//      This is the FILE, which the recorder owns and which is the truth. Two
//      different things, and naming them the same thing is how they get
//      confused for each other.
