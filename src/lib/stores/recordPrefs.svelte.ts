// The record room's one preference — and it is an autonomy choice rather
// than a setting. KP's ⚛ word, 2026-08-12: "settings could offer a user a
// choice … to provide autonomy", then the shape itself: "none is held, all
// are a set max length or stopped early, no holding — the other is hold only
// the current recording as it is open and not stopped."
//
// 'hold'    — a take may be held open. Resume rejoins the same take. The mic
//             stays open while held, which is said plainly in the room.
// 'bounded' — nothing is ever held. Every take runs to a maximum length or is
//             stopped early, so the microphone is open ONLY while actually
//             recording. The cap is enforced on the capture thread in Rust,
//             never by a timer in this window — a promise about a microphone
//             must not depend on whether a webview is awake.
//
// CARRIED from `resonance-assets/sistrum-inheritance/` (Phase 3 Wave 1,
// 2026-08-13, an Opus hand). One change: the storage keys wear this house's
// name. Phase 1 rebranded every localStorage key to the `resonance-sistrum-*`
// shape and these arrived saying `compass_*` — a key that still names the app
// it came from is a small lie two apps could trip over on one machine.
